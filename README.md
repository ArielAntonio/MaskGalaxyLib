# MaskGalaxyLib
The library developed is composed of three modules: The first corresponds to Get Image Source (GIS), which obtains the image from the SDSS SkyServer Image Cutout. The image obtained is entered into the Mask Galaxy Detection (MGD) module, which detects astronomical objects and their morphological classification by means of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Finally, the output generated by MGD serves as input for the third module called Get Astronomical Catalog (GAC), which establishes the coordinates in pixels of the galaxies detected in the MGD module.
